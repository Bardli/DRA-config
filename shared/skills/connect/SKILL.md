# SSH Connect

Use this skill to decide whether cluster work should run locally on the current host or remotely over SSH, and to establish the needed SSH path when it is remote.

## Step 1: Detect the current environment

Run:

```bash
hostname -f
whoami
```

Interpret the result as follows:

- If hostname contains `greatlakes` or `gl-login`:
  - current cluster = **Great Lakes**
  - remote cluster = **Lighthouse**
  - remote alias = `lighthouse`
  - remote hostname = `lighthouse.arc-ts.umich.edu`
  - expect script = `~/.local/bin/ssh-lh-auto`
- If hostname contains `lighthouse` or `lh-login`:
  - current cluster = **Lighthouse**
  - remote cluster = **Great Lakes**
  - remote alias = `greatlakes`
  - remote hostname = `greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu`
  - expect script = `~/.local/bin/ssh-gl-auto`
- If hostname contains `fir.alliancecan.ca` or starts with `fir`:
  - current cluster = **Fir**
  - operate **locally** on this login node
  - do not try to SSH to Fir again
- Otherwise:
  - treat the machine as a **local machine / laptop**
  - for Fir work, operate **remotely** using:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -Y ${USER}@fir.alliancecan.ca
    ```

## Step 2: Decide local vs remote execution

Use this rule consistently:

- If already on the relevant cluster login node, operate **locally** there.
- If on a local machine or laptop and the target cluster is Fir, operate **remotely** by wrapping cluster commands in:
  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -Y ${USER}@fir.alliancecan.ca "<command>"
  ```
- If on Great Lakes and the target is Lighthouse, or vice versa, operate **remotely** using the existing SSH multiplexed path described below.

If the current host is already Fir, stop after a quick connectivity test:

```bash
hostname -f
whoami
sinfo --version 2>&1
```

Report that cluster commands should run locally on Fir.

## Step 3: Great Lakes <-> Lighthouse setup

Only use this section when the current host is Great Lakes or Lighthouse.

### 3.1 Check prerequisites

```bash
test -x ~/.local/bin/ssh-<remote-short>-auto && echo "script OK" || echo "script MISSING"
test -f ~/.env && grep -q '^SSH_UMICH_PASS=' ~/.env && grep -q '^SSH_DUO_OPTION=' ~/.env && echo "credentials OK" || echo "credentials MISSING"
grep -q "^Host[[:space:]]\\+<remote-alias>\\>" ~/.ssh/config 2>/dev/null && echo "ssh config OK" || echo "ssh config MISSING"
which expect 2>/dev/null && echo "expect OK" || echo "expect MISSING"
```

If all are present, skip to Step 3.4.

### 3.2 Credentials

If `~/.env` is missing `SSH_UMICH_PASS` or `SSH_DUO_OPTION`, tell the user to create it themselves. Do not handle their password directly.

Recommended contents:

```bash
SSH_UMICH_PASS="your_password_here"
SSH_DUO_OPTION="1"
```

Then:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.env
```

### 3.3 SSH config and helper script

Ensure:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

If needed, add the host entry:

**Great Lakes**
```text
Host greatlakes
    HostName greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu
    User <username>
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 86400
```

**Lighthouse**
```text
Host lighthouse
    HostName lighthouse.arc-ts.umich.edu
    User <username>
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p
    ControlPersist 86400
```

Then create the appropriate `expect` helper:

- `~/.local/bin/ssh-lh-auto` when going Great Lakes -> Lighthouse
- `~/.local/bin/ssh-gl-auto` when going Lighthouse -> Great Lakes

Use the existing repo convention: the helper should read `SSH_UMICH_PASS` and `SSH_DUO_OPTION` from `~/.env`, spawn `ssh -fN <remote-alias>`, answer the password prompt, and then send the Duo option.

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ssh-<remote-short>-auto
```

### 3.4 Establish and verify the connection

Check:

```bash
ssh -O check <remote-alias> 2>&1
```

If not already active, run:

```bash
~/.local/bin/ssh-<remote-short>-auto
```

Then verify:

```bash
ssh -O check <remote-alias> 2>&1
ssh <remote-alias> "hostname -f && whoami"
ssh <remote-alias> "sinfo --version 2>&1"
```

## Step 4: Local machine / laptop -> Fir

Only use this section when the current hostname does not look like Great Lakes, Lighthouse, or Fir.

### 4.1 Check prerequisites

```bash
test -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa && echo "ssh key OK" || echo "ssh key MISSING"
which ssh 2>/dev/null && echo "ssh OK" || echo "ssh MISSING"
```

If `~/.ssh/id_rsa` is missing, stop and ask the user to provide the correct SSH identity first.

### 4.2 Ask for the Duo passcode before the first remote action

Before any Fir login or remote Fir command, ask the user for their DUO passcode. Tell them the connection flow may prompt for it interactively.

### 4.3 Connectivity test

Use the exact Fir login path:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -Y ${USER}@fir.alliancecan.ca "hostname -f && whoami && sinfo --version 2>&1"
```

If this succeeds, remote Fir operations can use the same pattern:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -Y ${USER}@fir.alliancecan.ca "<command>"
```

When the user is on a local machine, all Fir-specific Slurm control commands, file inspection, and submissions should be executed this way instead of being run locally.

## Wrap up

Summarize the result in one of these forms:

### Already on target cluster

```text
## Fir: Operate Locally

- [x] Current host is the Fir login node
- [x] Slurm commands should run locally here
```

### Remote path established

```text
## Local Machine -> Fir: Connected

- [x] SSH key available
- [x] Remote shell: OK
- [x] Remote Slurm: available
- [x] Fir commands should be wrapped in ssh
```

### Cross-cluster socket established

```text
## Great Lakes <-> Lighthouse: Connected

- [x] SSH socket: active
- [x] Remote shell: OK
- [x] Remote Slurm: available
```
